# Simulated-Annealing
A very optimized and effective program to simulate the process of annealing. This was inspired by a program Mark Newman included in his textbook "Computational Physics".

I started with his program and made several drastic improvements to processing time, visualization time, and algorithm effectiveness. The changes were dramatic enough that the only part it has in common with the original program are the parts that make it a simulated annealing program.

P.S. here is a link to Mark Newman's program: http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/cp/programs/salesman.py
